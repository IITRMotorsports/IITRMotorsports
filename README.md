		- "With the rising cost of gasoline and its ever depleting reserves, the future of conventional vehicles is bleak. Vehicles running on alternative fuels like electricity, CNG, etc. provide a promising solution to the problem. Hence, The BOLT, the long term aim of the team is to advance the technology of electric vehicles so that they may become cheaper and more efficient compared to gasoline powered conventional cars. With this aim in mind and with the experience and confidence gained from the first two competitions, the team developed an all-electric vehicle and participated in FSAE Australasia 2015, held in Melbourne, Australia, December 2015. The car design was finalised after rigorous simulation and analysis of mechanical and electrical systems using software like Ansys, SolidWorks, ADAMS, MATLAB, Labsim and Multisim. After all this hardwork and patience, the team finally got its reward, being number one Indian team in the formula student electric rankings. Here is the complete report of our car from the competition FSAE Australasia."
